# Basic Chat App
A very basic chat app where users can connect, have their own "name", send messages, and be notified when another user connects/disconnects.

# How it works
1. When the user first connects, it will ask for the users name.
2. Then for anyone connected already, the app will say that persons name + "has connected"
3. if 2 people are in the chat room and one send a message, that message will show up on the other users screen but not the one that sent the message.
4. if a user disconnects, the message "name has disconnected" will appear where "name" is the name of the user that disconnected.
